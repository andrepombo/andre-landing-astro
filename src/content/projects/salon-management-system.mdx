## Overview

A full-stack salon management system that centralizes daily operations for beauty salons. The React/Vite frontend provides a modern, responsive dashboard integrated with a Django REST API. It supports client, team, services, and appointment management, with conflict prevention, localized validations, health checks, and analytics.

## Key Features

- **Client Management**  
  Full CRUD with name, email, phone, and address. Brazilian phone validation and formatting.

- **Team Management**  
  Manage professionals with contact info and specialties, linked to the services they perform.

- **Service Catalog**  
  Create and maintain services with name, description, price, and duration (validated).

- **Appointment Scheduling**  
  Book appointments linking clients, professionals, and one or more services. Tracks date/time, total price, notes, and status workflow:
  scheduled, confirmed, in progress, completed, cancelled, no-show.

- **Conflict Prevention**  
  Backend prevents double-booking when a professional is already occupied.

- **Admin Dashboard UI**  
  Sidebar navigation for Dashboard, Clients, Team, Services, and Appointments. Responsive design with gradients and subtle animations.

- **API-First + Docs**  
  Django REST Framework API with Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for clients, team, services, and appointments.

- **Localization & Validation**  
  Configured for Brazilian locale (timezone, language) and phone formatting/validation.

- **Health Checks & Error Handling**  
  Frontend tests API health, shows live connection status, displays friendly error toasts, and provides retry.

- **Analytics**  
  Page view tracking on route changes for usage insights.
